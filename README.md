H4H Blog Bot
===

House4Hack or H4H is a makerspace in Centurion, South Africa.  This telegram bot was create to increase visibility of the House4Hack meetups on Tuesday evenings.  The idea is to take a couple of pictures, add optional captions and a short prompt and for ChatGPT to compose a reasonably true account of a project or activity during the makerspace meetup.
