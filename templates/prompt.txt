I want you to write a blog article about a meetup at House4Hack.

{% if prev_post_count > 0 %}
Today's date is {{ date }}.

Below is the date, title and contents of previous blog posts from {{prev_post_count}} meetups at House4Hack. 
If a post about a previous meetup is relevant, you can refer to it in your post to create a better story, otherwise just ignore it.  
When referring to a meetup date, use language like "last month's meetup" or "the meetup in January".  
Do not repeat contents from previous posts, but rather use it create continuity between older posts and this post.
{% for post in prev_posts %}
Date: {{ post.date }}
Title:{{ post.title }}
Contents: {{ post.contents }}

{% endfor %}

{% endif %}


In this article, I want you to write about: {{ text_list }}
{% if caption_count > 0 %}
I have {{ caption_count }} photos to add in the article, with the following captions:
{{ captions }}

Indicate the location of the photo using square brackes, for example to place photo_1 write [photo_1]. 
Do not place photos in the middle of a sentence or paragraph, place it between paragraphs or at the end.  
Do not place the caption, only the location of the photo using square brackets.
{% endif %}

Add a title for the blog post at the top.
